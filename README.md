# INET 3102 Sample Basic HTML

Samples of very crude and very basic HTML

### Step 1 - Clone this Repo

Clone this repository to your computer (put it in a directory that makes sense).

git clone https://github.umn.edu/jaxberg/inet3102_sample_html.git


### Step 2 - View/Edit the HTML Files in a Code Editor

Open the folder in a code editor like Visual Studio Code to view the HTML files.  Each of the .html files shows a progression of HTML development.  Look at each "index" file one by one and see the changes made.

### Step 3 - View the HTML Files in a Browser

To see how the .html files will be rendered by a Web Brower (like Chrome, Firefox, Safari, et al), open up the repository directory using File Explorer (Windows) or Finder (MacOS)

Now simply double click on a .html file to view it in your default browser.

### Step 4 - (Optional or if Joe tells you to do this) Copy the Files to the HTML Directory of a Web Server

If you have a local webserver installed on your computer, like NGINX, you can serve up these pages by copying these files to the "html" directory.
